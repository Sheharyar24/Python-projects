# Basic Calculator
#### Creating a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


## Functionality
### Here are the requirements for the Basic Calculator project:
-----------

## 1. Arithmetic Operations:
### The calculator should be able to perform the following operations:
  + **Addition (+)**
  + **Subtraction (-)**
  + **Multiplication (*)**
  + **Division (/)**

## 2. Input Handling:
- **The calculator should accept input from the user in the form of an arithmetic expression**
- **The input should be read continuously until the user decides to exit the program.**

## 3. Output:
- **The calculator should display the result of the arithmetic operation**
- **It should handle and display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations (e.g., division by zero).**


## 4. User Interface:
- **The program should run in the command line.**
- **Provide clear instructions to the user on how to input expressions and how to exit the program.**
----


## Additional Features (Optional):
- **Will be added after the basic program is completed**
  + **Support for Parentheses:**
    + **Allow the user to input expressions with parentheses to enforce the order of operations**
  + **History:**
    + **Keep a history of the user's calculations and allow them to view past results.**
  + **Advanced Operations:**
    + **Implement additional operations like exponentiation (^), modulus (%), and square root (âˆš).**
  + **Input Validation:**
    + **Implement input validation to handle incorrect inputs.**
